# Xiaomi Watch, Miband 8, 9 (Pro) and Redmi Watch 4 Developer resources 

Resources are a bit hard to find since a lot of the documentation is in Chinese or Russian but I've collected what I've been able to find here.

**Mi Band 8 only:**

* [Sample watch faces in Lua](https://github.com/m0tral/MiWatchLuaWatchfaces)
* [Instructions for EasyFace](https://github.com/m0tral/EasyFace/wiki)

* [Notify for Xiaomi & Mi Fitness (to upload watchfaces)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mc.xiaomi1)
  

**App Development:**

* [Xiaomi Vela documentation](https://iot.mi.com/vela/quickapp/en/content/intro.html)
* [Tutorial for Xiaomi Vela development (Chinese, translated)](https://www-bandbbs-cn.translate.goog/threads/10471/?_x_tr_sl=hu&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp)
* [Chinese Community of Developers for Xiaomi Bands/Wearables](https://www.bandbbs.cn/)

There seems to be some good stuff at the last link (e.g Baidu maps for the Xiaomi Mi Band 8 Pro) but I haven't figured out how to install it and what the limitations are.

Hope this is useful! If there's additional links that you would like to add, feel free to open a PR.
